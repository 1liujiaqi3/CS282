<h3>MapApp (Assignment 1)</h3>

<H4>Getting Started</H4>

Before you start with Assignment 1 you'll need to do the following
things:

<UL>

<LI> Download and install Eclipse for Android. Instructions for doing
this are available in the MOOC <A
HREF="https://class.coursera.org/androidapps101-001/lecture">Creative,
Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps</A>, which requires
enrolling in that MOOC. <P>

<LI> Setup an account on <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, which is explained in a
video by Mike Walker.

</UL>

<H4>Overview of the MapApp Assignment</H4>

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Eclipse
to develop a simple Android application that displays a map given a
pair of latitude and longitude coordinates.

The application works as follows:<P>

<UL>

<LI> The user is prompted to enter a location as a pair of lat/long
coordinates, as shown in the following screenshot:

<TABLE cellpadding=15 border=0>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="figs/MapDemo1.jpg" width=350>
</TD>
</TABLE>

<LI> After the location has been entered, the location is displayed on
a map, as shown in the following screenshot:

<TABLE cellpadding=15 border=0>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="figs/MapDemo2.jpg" width=350>
</TD>
</TABLE>
</UL>

Note that the results will look somewhat different if you use a real
Android smartphone vs. using the AVD emulator shown in the screenshots
above.

<H4>Program Description</H4>

This assignment involves writing an Android program that has the
following features: <P>

<UL>

<LI> It contains an <CODE>MapAppActivity</CODE> class that uses a
<CODE>TextView</CODE> object to prompt for the location and then
stores the latitude and longitude in two <CODE>EditText</CODE>
objects.<P>

<LI> It uses a <CODE>Button</CODE> object with the label "Show
Location" to run the <CODE>showLocation()</CODE> method that uses the
lat/long values provided by the user to start an activity that
displays a map of the location.<P>

<LI> The <CODE>Button</CODE> that shows the location must be connected
to the <CODE>MapAppActivity.showLocation()</CODE> method via the
<CODE>android:onClick="showLocation"</CODE> attribute. <P>

<LI> Make sure to carefully check for errors in the latitude and
longitude values entered by the user.  If there are any problems with
the input please display helpful error messages via Android <A
HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html">Toasts</A>. <P>

<LI> The activity that displays the map must be started via an intent
and must not be written by you, e.g., the Browser app will handle
URI's with the prefix <CODE>http://maps.google.com</CODE>.  </UL>

The entire layout of the application must be structured by the
contents of the Android resource files described via XML, i.e., you
must <EM>not</EM> hard-code any <CODE>TextView</CODE>,
<CODE>EditText</CODE>, or <CODE>Button</CODE> objects into your
<CODE>MapAppActivity</CODE> class. <P>

All the lifecycle events associated with your
<CODE>MapAppActivity</CODE> class must be logged to LogCat via the
<CODE>Log.d()</CODE> method, e.g.:<P>

<CODE>
08-18 20:27:48.580: D/MapApp(3323): onCreate()<BR>
08-18 20:27:48.610: D/MapApp(3323): onStart()<BR>
08-18 20:27:48.610: D/MapApp(3323): onResume()<BR>
...<BR>
</CODE><P>

Your <CODE>MapAppActivity</CODE> class should inherit from a parent
class called LifecycleLoggingActivity that defines the associated hook
methods to perform this logging, as follows:

<PRE><CODE>
public class LifecycleLoggingActivity extends Activity {
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { 
      ...
    }

    public void onRestart() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }

    public void onStart() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }

    public void onResume() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }

    public void onPause() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }
	
    public void onStop() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }
	
    public void onDestroy() {
      // @@ TODO: you fill in here. 
    }
}
</PRE></CODE><P>

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must do the following additional work: 

<UL>

<LI> You must support default latitude and longitude values if the
user doesn't provide any.  By default, these values should point to
Vanderbilt University. <P>

<LI> First try to use the <CODE>geo:</CODE> URI intent solution, which
should work if you're running on an Android phone (I recommend using
the approach described <A
HREF="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/sending.html#Verify">here</A>
to see if this works).  If the <CODE>geo:</CODE> URI intent doesn't
work (e.g., if there is no app configured to handle it) then use the
<CODE>http://maps.google.com</CODE> URI intent instead, which launches
the Browser app. <P>

</UL>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/A1-Android">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

The MapApp is intentionally designed to be easy to help you get
familiar with installing/using Eclipse and Android. Information useful
for learning how to write this application is available in Week 2 of
the MOOC <A
HREF="https://class.coursera.org/android-001/lecture">Programming
Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems</a>, which requires
you to register for this MOOC. Likewise, the <A
HREf="http://commonsware.com/warescription">the Busy Coder's Guide to
Android Development</A> textbook.  I recommend you read this material.
It's also helpful to work through the various tutorials in that
book. <P>

If you find it extremely hard to complete this assignment you may not
be ready to take this class.  If this is the case, I recommend you
take the <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs251/">Intermediate
Software Design</A> course (CS 251) first since it focuses on the
patterns and tactics of effective OO design and programming.<P>
